Must_Follow: Your client must follow these or else using it with other clients in Tox will be very difficult or impossible.

Important: Your client must follow these but not following them won't make it impossible to use with other clients. It might cause some headaches for users though.

Medium_Importance: Your client should follow these for optimal compatibility with other clients.

Recommendations: These are just recommendations, your client doesn't have to follow them but you should check them out.
